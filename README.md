  running the code is given in the file `cornellbox.png` or `cornelbox.ppm`.

*Compilation*

   The program was compiled using GCC via the following command: `gcc -o RayTracer.o RayTracer.cpp -lstdc++ -lm -o3`.
   To run use `./RayTracer.o [SAMPLE_COUNT]` and the image will be written to `cornellbox.ppm`.
